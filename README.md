## JSMix · JSMixStarter · A bridge between Javascript & Swift
The goal of this project is to build a thin bridge between Javascript and 
native Swift code so that a common javascript can be slowly introduced
and shared to both native iOS and Android applications.

This starter project includes a BDD test harness using Quick & Nimble and 
has a mirror javascript project, js-mix-starter, that uses Mocha & Chai.
